Brief Reflection
Working on this portfolio project allowed me to enhance my React and frontend development skills while building a fully interactive site. The biggest challenge was ensuring all components, images, and projects displayed correctly across different sections, which required careful debugging and attention to detail. My favorite part was creatively designing the interactive sections and integrating smooth navigation. This project reinforced the importance of testing, version control, and deploying a live site for real-world use.
